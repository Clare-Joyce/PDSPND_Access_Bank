### Create a repo from scratch

- git init: create brand new git repositories in your computer. This command sets up all of the necessary files and directories that Git will use to keep track of everything. The `.git` folder is created to track changes.
- git clone: clonea an existing remote repo into your local machine. One can clone and change the project name `git clone <url> new_name`.
To get access to the cloned repo, you have to `cd repo_name`
- git status: displays info on the state of the repo.

## you can't have nested Git repositories.
