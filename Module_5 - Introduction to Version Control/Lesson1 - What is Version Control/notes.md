### What is version control?

A save point(time, author, state) that allows you to change anything in your project knowing that nothing (previous versions) will be lost.

Version Control is a software that helps you control different versions of a project.

#### VCS Info
- Three most popular VCS 
    - Git
    - Subversion
    - Mercurial

- There are two main types of VCS models
    - centralized
    - distributed

VCS helps you maintain a detailed history of the project with the ability to work on different version of the project.

Note Git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is the VCS and GitHub is a Service that hosts Git projects.

### Version Control in Daily Use
- `ctrl z`, `cmd z` in documents
- revision on Google docs.

These situations have limited compared to using Git.

### Git and Version Control Terminology
- **VCS** is a tool that manages different versions of source code. Also known as source code manager (SCM).
- **Commit** basically saves the state of your project. It takes a snapshot of the current state of your project and stores a reference to the snapshot.
- **Repository / repo** a directory or folder that contains your work. 
- **staging index:** contains files that are about to be committed.
- working directory

*Note:* 
* When a commit is made, only the changes that are in the staging index are moved to the repository.
* Git records changes to files as commits.
